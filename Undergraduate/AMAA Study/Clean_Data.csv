Three weeks a year is so little compared to the stressors of residency and the amount of hours he works (which typically varies between 60-80hr weeks).     Also, I will forever be saddened by how little time off my husband was given after the birth of our children. He was given a couple days off during medical school where we had 2 kids, which is unfortunate but understandable as it is school. But in residency, where he is a (underpaid) employee, sacrificing holidays, weekends,  nights, call shifts, etc. with very little pay, giving much of our lives to the hospital and program he is apart of. And when he had a major life event with the birth of our third child 7 months ago, he was â€œallowedâ€ 3 sick days after the birth of our son. He had the option to apply for FMLA to use more of his sick days/his vacation time. So he took 2 more sick days through FMLA for a total of 5 days home with our family. No paternity leave option. I will always be sad that this is all the time we got with him as newbornhood goes so fast. It felt very insulting after all that he gives to his program and to others through his career.     More time off would be huge and such a benefit. It not only allows for reprieve from the stressors of their day to day lives, but also shows that they are valued and their time and experiences matter.

I would like to see them make an investment by actually listening to and putting into practice changes that are suggested by the physicians working with patients rather than administrators who are not involved in patient care.    2. If my husband could have a scribe at work it would decrease his hours doing paperwork every day.    3.  More vacation time every year would be nice.  He currently does not have PTO. He must work more hours before and after a vacation if he wants to take time off.  4.  Allowing for a more balanced work week so he isn't working so many hours a week.  5.  We feel as though his workplace does not care about the needs of internal medicine providers and focuses all of their resources (salary, PTO, decision making, etc) on sub specialists.  6. Better health care benefits.  Our health care benefits and the cost of insurance is much worse when compared with others both in and out of medicine.

",Strongly agree,"I would like to see more focus on mental and physical health for physicians in general, especially trainees. With the hours, workload and physical/mental strain on their bodies, I would like for my husband to be able to make his own doctor's appointments, take time to get exercise but not feel like he's falling behind or can't take care of his own wellbeing. Physicians should ""practice what they preach"" and make sure that their health is a priority.    I would like to see our workplace provide opportunities for myself (and other spouses) to train or learn best practices in how I can further support my husband at home - whether it be related to our marriage, to supporting him on tough days (patient loss, mistakes made at work, juggling work and personal life). We are a team in our marriage, and with medicine being such a HUGE part of our lives, I feel that we should have the resources to reference if we can see that our spouse is struggling.     Medical Family Counseling would also be a great resource for families who are struggling through various circumstances. Sometimes, as a spouse, you can feel alone - so to have a professional, who is equipped with training and experience in working with medical families to help guide couples/families through difficult times would also be helpful.     Overall appreciation for doctors and their families - so often they are not celebrated enough. Physicians and trainees sacrifice so very much, and at times do not get enough recognition for their dedication and hard work. I'd love to see our workplace recognize, reward and support our spouses in their fields. Even recognition of the families' sacrifices could bring more appreciation, community and sense of purpose as they are a huge part of this journey. ",0,Yes,Yes,Yes,29,Female,,Male,,Midwest,

Please trust physicians or physicians in training to be adults and make responsible decisions on their own. Weâ€™re from out of state, and have no family living in the state we attend medical school in. For us to visit family, itâ€™s a full weekend trip at a minimum. There have been times in the past where a family emergency or family event has come up with our family back home and my husband hasnâ€™t been able to get his absence approved by the school, so heâ€™s had to miss out on things with both of our families. With aging parents and grandparents, this is a problem and the guilt weighs on him when heâ€™s unable to make important family events. The school and systemâ€™s lack of understanding that there is MORE to his life than just being a physician has also impacted our decision on when to have children, as we worry that he wonâ€™t be around much during their formative years and family help will be far away. More understanding, flexibility, and compassion would go a long way in decreasing physician burnout. ",26,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,,,,,,,
